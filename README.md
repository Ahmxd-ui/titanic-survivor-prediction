# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 🎯 Objective
To build a Machine Learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck with high accuracy, moving from a baseline model to an optimized production-ready pipeline.

## ❓ Problem
The challenge is a binary classification problem: using passenger data (such as Age, Sex, Class, and Fare) to predict survival (0 = Died, 1 = Survived) for a test set where the outcome is hidden.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, GridSearchCV)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

🚀 How to Run

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/Ahmxd-ui/titanic_survivor_project.git
cd titanic_survivor_project

Install dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Standard Model:
Bash

python src/main.py

Run the Tuned Model (Best Accuracy):
Bash

    python src/main_tuned.py

    This will perform Grid Search and save submission_tuned.csv.

📋 Examples

Input Data (Raw): | PassengerId | Pclass | Sex | Age | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | 1 | 3 | male | 22.0 | | 2 | 1 | female | 38.0 |

Output File (submission.csv): | PassengerId | Survived | | :--- | :--- | | 892 | 0 | | 893 | 1 |

🧪 Tests

    Validation Strategy: 80/20 Train-Test split.

    Metrics Used: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix.

    Current Performance: * Baseline: ~79%

        Tuned Random Forest: ~83.3%

💡 Key Takeaways

    Built a reusable data cleaning pipeline (handling missing values for Age/Embarked).

    Implemented automated Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV.

    Solved "Environment Hell" by using a dedicated Python venv.
